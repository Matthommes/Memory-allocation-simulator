# Memory Allocation Simulator

## Project Scope

The purpose of this project is to simulate memory allocation, deallocation and fragmentation in a simplified environment. It will mimic the behavior of 'malloc', 'realloc' and 'free' in C.

### What's Included

- Simulation memory allocation ('malloc')
- Handling memory reallocation('realloc')
- Simulation memory deallocation ('free')
- Tracking memory fragmentation.

### What's not included

- OS-specific memory management (e.g virtual memory or paging)
- Multi-threading or concurrency issues.

## Project Objectives

- Implement memory allocation and deallocation functions
- Track memory usage dynamically
- Implement fragmentation and block merging
- Write test cases for each feature
- Create a clear output for memory stats.
